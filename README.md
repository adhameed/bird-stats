# BirdStats

BirdStats is a toy project demonstrating the use of Chartist and Bulma in a static context.

If you ever wanted to make something like this normally, I would definitely recommend using
npm or a related package manager rather than hand writing things!

## Installation

See backend/README.md for details on installation of the backend.

## Running the BirdStats Demo

Assuming you're using Ubuntu Linux or some flavour of POSIX, you need only do the following:

* Start the backend from your terminal: 
```bash
cd backend && source venv/bin/activate && python src/app.py
```
* Open the static front end in another terminal
```bash
cd frontend/src && firefox index.html
```
